<h2>Introducing GPIO</h2>
As we all know beagleboard has an expansions connector where multiple signals can be routed via kernel or u-boot multiplexing.
Many different expansion interfaces can be routed on those pins, such as additional UARTs, SPIs and many more.
Major resource for this is <a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardPinMux">elinux.org/BeagleBoardPinMux</a> where you can 
find more informations.  Our interest for the expansion connector in this example is pointed to the simplest kind of IO 
port available on common embedded platforms: <i>GPIOs</i> <small>(in brief, GPIOs are single digital pins that could be moved high or low as user desires)</small>.

<h3>Enabling GPIOs on beagleboard expansions connector</h3>
In order to use GPIOs on beagleboard expansion connector the appropiate signals have to be routed to the right balls.
Modification to the multiplexer settings can be done via kernel or u-boot patching. Again, that argument is out of our
scope, and again elinux.org is our preferred source of information.  Fortunately, some GPIOs are routed by default on
main expansion connector, and we could safely use them for our example. You can refer to <a href="http://beagleboard.org/static/BBSRM_latest.pdf"> Beagleboard Reference Manual</a> to find out which GPIOs are ready to be used, without getting
dirty with low level bootloader or kernel patching.

<h2>Controlling GPIOs from user space</h2>
There are basically two ways to control a GPIO pins from userspace:<em> memory mapping</em> or <em>sysfs</em>.<br>
Memory mapping method  just requires a <em>mmap</em> call, and  some datasheet readings. Simply put: it maps the desired memory area into
a userspace buffer to make possible modify it.<br>
I suppose that just 16bits are necessary for controlling a GPIO, since the PADCONF array is composed by word-sized 
(32bits) registers each one controlling 2 pins...
<br>
The second method exploits  <em>sysfs </em> power, using its so called 'event interface'.
Symply put (again): you write specific commands to a file and kernel acts accordingly. Nice uh?
<br><p>

Three actions are possible on a sysfs entry in order to control a GPIO pin:
<ul>
	<li><i>Export</i></li>
	<li><i>Write high/low</i></li>
	<li><i>Unexport</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Before you can do anything on the chosen pin you have to export it.<br>
Suppose you want to use gpio139 (pin 3 on C4 expansion connector), simply write:<p>
<pre><code> % echo 139 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export</code></pre><p>
A new sysfs entry called gpio139 will appear under <em>/sys/class/gpio/</em> directory.<br>
Now it's possible to control pin status:<p>
<pre><code>
% echo "low"  &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio139/direction
% echo "high" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio139/direction
</code></pre>
<p>
You will find more useful files under <em>gpio139</em> directory, such as <em>value</em> that reports the actual pin status.<br>
When you don't need the gpio any more you can unexport it.<p>
<pre><code>
% echo 139 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/unexport
</code></pre><p>
We all agree, sysfs is great, and if you have do bash scripting is quite the only feasible solution.

<h1>The kernel side</h1>
GPIO is probably one of the simplest examples of how kernel developers exposes API not only for user space applications, 
but also for other kernel modules and drivers.
<p>
Linux kernel provides a nice library called <em>gpiolib </em>that exposes some common gpio related functions, 
in order to abstract a little from bare hardware gpio controller installed on you board.<br>

Kernel documentation comes with a useful gpio.txt file, which is worth to read in order to understand how
<em>gpiolib</em> behaves and what does it provide to other kernel modules.<br>

<p>
Basically the necessary operations are the three we have seen before, but this time those tasks are accomplished 
by kernel code.<br>
Furthermore, gpiolib provides a sysfs compatibility layer (exactly the one we have used before from userspace).<p>

Now, why the hell one should write a kernel module when you could do everything you want, not only from user space,
but with a single 4 line bash file??<br>
I guess the 'because it's funny' answer is not the right one for many of us...<br>
<P>
The real reason why gpio are interesting also in kernel space are interrupts.<p>

First of all, it's impossible to manage interrupts within user space applications (that's not completely true)
and a gpio, as any other digital line that can be driven high or low, can be used for triggering interrupts.<br>
Before presenting the code, we have to learn how to manage interrupts and what kind of issues are involved in
interrupts handling.
<p>
The best available resource is chapter 10 of <strong>Linux Device Driver </strong>from which you can learn everything you need to understand what is going on there (and much more).

<h3>Hardware</h3>

The hardware wiring is just a simple button switch connected to a beagleboard GPIO pin. That switch is kept high with a 2K pull up resistor, but when pressed connects the GPIO to GND. To get a visual feedback of what is going on, connect a led to another pin of you choice, this will be the 'blinking' led.

<h3>Kernel Module</h3>
Skipping all the details related to device driver writing, only the interesting code sections are shown here, such as interrupt installing, and interrupt low and top halves.<p>

In module init we have to request the gpio we desire, set its direction and finally set up a <em>workqueue</em> 
to be used for spawning a kernel thread to manage interrupt.
<p>
<pre><code>
int blink_gpio=139;/*gpio 3 on expansion*/ /*module param*/
int interrupt_gpio=138;/*GPIO 5 on expansion*/ /*module param*/
...
if (!gpio_is_valid(blink_gpio)){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "The requested GPIO is not available \n");
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto invalid;
}
if (!gpio_is_valid(interrupt_gpio)){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "The requested GPIO is not available \n");
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto invalid;
}
/*we have requested  valid gpios*/
if(gpio_request(blink_gpio, "blinking_led")){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Unable to request gpio %d", blink_gpio);
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto invalid;
}
if(gpio_request(interrupt_gpio, "gpio_interrupt")){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Unable to request gpio %d",interrupt_gpio);
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto free_and_return1;
}

/*set gpio direction*/
if( (dir_err=gpio_direction_output(blink_gpio, value)) &lt; 0 ){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Impossible to set output direction");
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto free_and_return2;
}
if( (dir_err=gpio_direction_input(interrupt_gpio)) &lt; 0 ){
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Impossible to set input direction");
  retval=-EINVAL;
  goto free_and_return2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
As said before interrupt handling is usually done using a top half handler, that starts some work that will be
accomplished in a later time, in a context that is less critical than an handler (where some constraints such as high
speed, no sleeping  and low latency have to be respected).

<p>
To do so, usually  <em>workqueues</em> or<em> kernel tasklets</em> are employed.
<p>

In this example we will install a workqueue with an associated work, that will be spawned by top half interrupt handler
in order to complete the desired task (invert the led  state).

<p>
<pre><code>
static void
change_led_state
(struct work_struct *work)
{
  int new_value = invert_value(value);
  gpio_set_value(blink_gpio, new_value);
  value = new_value;

  return;
}

/*set up work queue*/
 if ( !(wq=create_singlethread_workqueue("blink_wq")) ){
   printk(KERN_ALERT "unable to setup workqueue\n");
   retval=-EINVAL;
   goto free_and_return2;
 }

 /*setup work struct*/
 INIT_DELAYED_WORK(&amp;work, change_led_state);
 if (&amp;work==NULL){
   printk(KERN_ALERT "Unable to set work to be executed\n");
   retval=-EINVAL;
   goto destroy_workqueue;
 }</code></pre>

<p>
Finally we have to install and write the handler:
<p>
<pre><code>
/*
 * Interrupt Handler
 */
irqreturn_t change_state_interrupt
(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Interrupt\n");
  /*send work to be scheduled*/
  queue_delayed_work(wq, &amp;work, (long) 0);
  return IRQ_HANDLED;
}
...
...
 /*install interrupt handler*/
 if ( (irq_line=gpio_to_irq(interrupt_gpio)) &lt; 0){
   printk(KERN_ALERT "Gpio %d cannot be used as interrupt",interrupt_gpio);
   retval=-EINVAL;
   goto destroy_workqueue;
 }

 if ( (irq_req_res = request_irq(irq_line,
   change_state_interrupt, IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING,
   "gpio_change_state", NULL)) &lt; 0){
   if (irq_req_res == -EBUSY)
     retval=irq_req_re;
   else
     retval=-EINVAL;
   goto destroy_workqueue;
 }</code></pre>
<p>
The interrupt handler does nothing more than scheduling the <em>work</em> on the workqueue <em>wq</em> to be executed.
<br>
The <em>workqueue </em>will request a kernel thread that will execute the <em>change_led_state </em>function, that will run concurrently to the rest of the device driver.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
This is just one of the simplest examples about GPIO and interrupt  handling.
<p>
GPIO is the basical form of communication available in almost all platforms, and a good understanding of the available software support is necessary to start working with embedded Linux.

<p>
GPIOs are employed in a number of different situations.

SPI protocol is a good example. In this protocol only the 'master' device can start the communication.
Sometimes 'slave devices' want to start communicating too, but it is necessary to wake-up the master and ask it to start the communication first.
In that situations, an interrupt connected to a GPIO is the easiest and faster solution, given that no additional hardware is required (1 wire connection and eventually a pull up resistor) and the required code is relatively small.

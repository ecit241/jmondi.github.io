<h2>Pre:</h2>
With embedded sensors becoming even more cheaper and even more numerous, needs for a more standardized form of
communication arise day by day.
<br>Standard protocols, like <i>ZigBee</i> are slowly moving away from the <i>isolated sensor network</i> communication
model, embracing new paradigms based upon new standards and methodologies.<br>
Thanks to the introduction of <i>IPv6</i> and new network protocols, like <i>6LowPan</i>, sensor networks are 
rapidly becoming first class citizens on the internet network. 
<p>
Standard protocols and tools, employed every day on the internet, such as TCP/IP, network monitoring
tools and network equipment, are now available also for sensor networks, since those are becoming everyday 
more integrated in the existing infrastructure. 
<p>
<b>HetNet</b> <i>(Heterogeneous Networking)</i> is a simple custom board built to demonstrate the potential of 
<b>IP-enabled</b> networked embedded devices.<br>Using the <a href="http://www.sics.se/%7Eadam/mobisys2003.pdf"> <b>uIP</b></a> embedded TCP/IP stack, it is possible to build with few lines of code a working HTTP server or an SMTP clients,
just to name a few of the existing examples.
<p>
The experiment is performed in conjunction with an <i>augmented reality</i> application, 
for a mobile device, that provides a visual feedback of a physical phenomenon, the distance between an hand and 
the board.
<br>The test-bed is realized by means of standard network equipment and the interaction between the mobile application and
the sensor board is performed with standard HTTP requests/responses.
<br>The board also exposes an auto-refreshing web page that displays sensed data and is reachable with a standard
browser.
<p>
Main inspiration for the experiment comes from SICS' <a href="http://www.contiki-os.org/2011/08/ipsn-2010-demo-ip-based-sensor-network.html"> demo </a> presented at  <i>IPSN 2010</i>.

<h2>Hardware building blocks</h2>
HetNet is an hand-made board, inspired by the numerous existing boards equipped with an Ethernet interface.
<br> One of the most known is <a href="http://tuxgraphics.org/electronics/200611/embedded-webserver.shtml">TuxGraphics's Ethernet board</a>, but also the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield"> Arduino Ethernet shield</a> is a known example.
<p>
To minimize the need of writing new drivers or porting existing code to a new architecture, standard components
have been chosen as building blocks for the project.
<p>
It can seems strange speaking of wireless sensor networks, while employing an Ethernet enabled board, but as of today 
is possible to switch to another kind of network interface quite straightforwardly.
<br>Many wireless interfaces that can be employed with micro-controllers exist today. Ranging from 802.11 radios, 
controlled by means of serial AT commands, to 802.15.4 interfaces sometimes integrated within the micro.
<br>Switching to a new interface is simply a question of writing a new minimal device driver, with a minimal 
hardware integration effort.

<h3>Micro and Ethernet Controller</h3>
The board is built around two main components, an <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=4198"> ATMega328p micro-controller</a> and an <a href="http://olimex.com/dev/index.html"> ENC28J60 Ethernet controller based board by Olimex</a> .<br>
The board is also equipped with an RS232 connector to provide a serial debugging interface and an ISP connector to program
the ATMega chip. To perform the translation from TTL logical levels found on the ATMega serial port a standard MAX3232 IC has been employed.<br>
The total board cost is around 30E, if industrialized a board like this one can cost less that 10E.
<p>

<p>
<h3>Powering and Clock</h3>
The ATMega is powered at 3.3V for compatibility reasons with ENC28J60 chip, and is clocked using the internal 8MHz 
RC-oscillator.
<br>This is usually a bad design choice, because RC oscillators provide less precision than external 
crystal resonators, but since this is a prototype board, designed to run for short periods, that setup will fit our 
needs in an acceptable way. 

<p>
<h3>Sensors</h3>
The board is also equipped with an external range finder.
<br> A range finder is a sensor that, by means of an internal sonar, is
able to understand the distance between itself and an item residing in front of it. For the experiment an <a href="http://www.maxbotix.com/products/MB1010.htm">LV-MaxSonar-EZ1</a>
manufactured by MaxBotix has been employed.
<br>This sensor supports various output formats, such as serial digital output, PWM and an analog voltage output.
The latter has been chosen because of its simplicity.

<h2>Software building blocks</h2>
<h3>The uIP embedded TCP/IP stack</h3>
The <b>uIP</b> TCP/IP stack has been designed in 2003 by Adam Dunkels, and is targeted specifically for networked 
embedded devices with few Kbytes of memory.<br>
It provides and RFC-compliant implementation of the TCP/IP protocols, with a typical memory footprint of 200 bytes.
<br>uIP targeted applications are built upon another software tool developed by Dunkels and others at SICS, <a href="http://www.sics.se/%7Eadam/dunkels05using.pdf"><b>protothreads</b> and <b>protosockets</b></a>.
<br>This software tools provide a sort of cooperative multithreading useful to develop applications abstracting from the 
explicit state machine style, that is typical of event based systems. Furthermore a 'BSD socket'-like interface is 
provided for the interaction with the network stack.
<p>
<br>uIP is today part of <i>RIME</i>, the network stack of the well-known <a href="http://www.contiki-os.org/"><b>Contiki OS</b></a>, stand-alone versions already exists, targeted to specific architectures.
<br>This project is based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avr-uip/"> avr-uip</a> port, a stand-alone uIP 
implementation targeted to AVR cpus.
<br>A customized version, with some additional applications and some fixes for the UART and 1-Wire library can be found 
on my github repo <a href="https://github.com/jmondi/hetnet_avr-uip">hetnet_avr-uip</a>. 

<p>
<h3>Threads and main loop</h3>
Applications for uIP are usually written using protothreads and protosockets, to communicate with the network stack and to
support thread execution.
<br>The application is composed by several concurrent threads:
<pre>
<br>  - A thread for distance sensing
<br>  - A thread for blinking leds
<br>  - The network application thread
</pre> 
<p>
All that threads are scheduled by the main loop by means of successive invocations.
<br>A protothread is simply a C function that exploits specific macros to release
the execution until some specified condition do not evaluate to true.
<p>
<br>The simplest possible thread, with minimal complexity is the <i>blink thread</i>:
<pre><code>
static 
PT_THREAD(blink(void))
{
	PT_BEGIN(&blink_thread);

		printf("led ON\n");
		led_on();

		timer_set(&blink_timer, CLOCK_CONF_SECOND);
		PT_WAIT_UNTIL(&blink_thread, 
				timer_expired(&blink_timer));

		printf("Led OFF\n");
		led_off();

		timer_set(&blink_timer, CLOCK_CONF_SECOND);
		PT_WAIT_UNTIL(&blink_thread,
				timer_expired(&blink_timer));

	PT_END(&blink_thread);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
This thread simply lights up a led, wait until a timer is expired and then switch off the led.
<br>While thread is sleeping, another concurrent one can execute, when blink function is again invoked
the timer is checked again, and if the condition evaluates to true execution proceeds, otherwise control
returns to the calling function.
<p>
Main loop simply continuously calls protothread functions, performing a primitive scheduling between threads.

<pre><code>
	while(1){
		blink(); /*thread*/
		read_distance(0); /*thread*/
		uip_len = network_read(); /*get packet from the network*/

		if(uip_len > 0) {
			if(BUF->type == htons(UIP_ETHTYPE_IP)){
				/* 
				 * IP Packet: process headers and call application thread
				 */
			}else if(BUF->type == htons(UIP_ETHTYPE_ARP)){
				/*
				 * ARP request: reply to ARP req
				 */
			}
		}else if(timer_expired(&periodic_timer)) {
			/*
			 * TIMER EXPIRED: ARP update and periodic poll
			 */	
		}
	}
</code></pre>

<h3>Network Applications</h3>

When an IP packet is received it is passed directly to the network stack that performs some operations on the headers to 
determinate which kind of packet the application is actually handling.<br>When the network application is called it has 
to check which flags have been enabled by the stack, and act accordingly (ie. if a re-transmission is requested the
application has to reproduce the lost packets).

<p>
Two different applications have been developed for this project.
<br> The first is an auto refreshing page that displays real-time distances reading the range finder output. The second 
is a simple HTTP server, that gives back the distance or the temperature sensed by the uController using arguments 
passed by means of HTTP GET requests. Both the applications reside in the github repo, named <i>simple_ajax</i> and 
<i>httpd_custom</i> respectivly.

<h2>Testing and Demo</h2>
Since the board has been developed to perform a demo test in conjunction with a mobile application that performs an
augmented reality animation, this specific use case will be described.
<br>Since <i>HetNet</i>, as any other sensor board powered with <i>uIP, Contiki</i> 
can be connected directly to standard network equipment it is possible to use any kind of setup, totally 
wired or partially wireless, as we have done in our test-bed.

<h3>Test-bed setup</h3>
For the demonstration we have performed for the department <i>Career Day</i> event, a simple 802.11g access point 
has been employed. We have setup a standard wireless network and connected the board directly to one of the access 
point's  Ethernet ports.
<br>We have then connected the mobile device to the wireless network and used a simple printed tag to start the 
measurement.<br>The device start performing HTTP requests to the board's IP address, receiving back HTML text, that 
is parsed in order to extract relevant information.
<br>The actual distance is then calculated and displayed in the animation.
